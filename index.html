        <h2> History </h2>
        <p>Joseph and Judy Blades are pioneers in BC Certified Organic farming and their beginnings date back to 1996. The farm is located in the semi aired region of Spence's Bridge which boasts one of the friendliest growing climates in Canada.</p>


        <p>Mary and Jacob Anderson were growing organic produce on this land decades before anyone had even heard the phrase "Organic Produce". Judy and Joseph have continued on in this tradition with a love for real food grown by Mother Nature.</p>
